# QOSF

In this repository is a Jupyter Notebook that sovles QOSF task 2 and describes my approach. 

## Problem description
- Implement a circuit that returns $|01\rangle$ and $|10\rangle$ with equal probability.
- Use only `CNOT`, `RX`, and `RY`.
- Find parameters with gradient descent.
- Simulations must be done with sampling and noise.
- Compare loss for sampling with [1, 10, 100, 1000] shots before learning.
